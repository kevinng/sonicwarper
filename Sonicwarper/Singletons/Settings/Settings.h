//  This is a singleton class that provides the global settings for the app. Persistent data
//  is provided by NSUserDefaults. On initialization, the Settings singleton object attempts to
//  read from the NSUserDefaults class for the data it needs. If the data is not found, then the
//  initial data is inserted into the NSUserDefaults class and used.
